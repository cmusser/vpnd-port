vpnd provides an encrypted virtual connection between two hosts, allowing
the creation of secure network topologies. It uses NaCl for encryption and
frequently changes the shared key used for communicating, thereby providing
forward secrecy.

vpnd supports two VPN use cases:

- Network Gateway Mode: An individual client host needing access
  to a remote network, and a security gateway providing access to
  one or more such clients. This allows individual clients to
  access a main network.

- Host/Host Gateway Mode: A pair of hosts acting as security
  gateways that connect two internal networks together via a
  secure link. This connects all the hosts in two sites together.
